DESCRIPTION :

This Python script is a penetration testing tool that combines port scanning and brute force attacks for ethical security testing. It scans a target IP/hostname for open ports (with service detection and banner grabbing) and optionally performs password brute-forcing on web login forms. The tool includes multi-threading for faster scans, customizable port ranges, and supports built-in/common passwords, custom wordlists, or file-based inputs. Designed for authorized security testing only, it provides clear terminal output while emphasizing legal/ethical use through warnings.
